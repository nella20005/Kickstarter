Analysis of the success of projects on Kickstarter 
<br><b>Kickstarter – Is it really worth it?</b>

This is an analysis of Kickstarter projects and determining what types of projects are successful on the site.


<br>Installations</u>
<br>•	Python 3.6.9
•	Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Mathplotlib and Sci-Kit Learn



<br>Project Motivation
<br>I am curious to see what is involved in having a successful Kickstarter project. I want to know what projects are best to receive funding through this site. I also would like know what can a person consider when launching a project on this site.


<br>File Descriptions
<br>•	Jupyter Notebook File: kick starter.ipynb
•	Data Files: ks2018.csv

<br>Process
<br>•	Prepare data
•	Gather necessary data to answer your questions
•	Handle categorical and missing data
•	Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
•	Analyze, Model, and Visualize


<br>Data Analysis
After looking at the data, I came up with five questions I wanted to see if the data can answer for me. Below are the questions:

1.	Top 5 categories with the number
2.	What is the percentage complete the goal?
3.	Kick start project with the most backers
4.	List the projects with over 100% of goal
5.	Can we predict the success of launching our own kickstarter based on the following factors?
<br>The data we looked at was Kickstarter projects in 2018. There was a total of 378,661 projects that seek funding on through the website. The first question I asked was what was the top five categories that received funding. Based on the analysis I can conclude that this site is good for Product Design, Documentary, Music, Tabletop Games, and Shorts.    

Now that we know what projects are best for funding, I wanted to know out of the 378,661 projects, how many were successful in completing their fundraising goal? Based on my calculations, only 33% of campaigns are successful.  It makes me ask is this worth the effort?

Next, I created a graphical representation to see what countries the projects come from. The majority of the campaigns are based in the United States. I’m not surprised since KickStarter is based in the United States.

 I then compared the type of projects by category. This is a good way of seeing how much competition your project who have. There was over 16% of all projects were film and video following music at 14%. Once can conclude that this site would be a good funding source for projects related to the arts.

 Lastly, I created a model to show the success rate. The factors considered were the project’s goal, the total amount pledged and the number of backers. Based on these factors, the success rate should be 52% success.


<br>Conclusion
<br>The data we looked at was Kickstarter projects in 2018. There was a total of 378,661 projects that seek funding on through the website. Based on the analysis I can conclude that this site is good for projects geared towards Product Design, Documentary, Music, Tabletop Games, and Shorts.  The site seems to be popular in the United States. Also considering factors such as the project’s goal, the total amount pledged and the number of backers it seems that there is a 52% success rate.
